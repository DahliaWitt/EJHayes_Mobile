	   Welcome to Middle School! E.J. Hayes is a safe and nurturing learning enviroment. Middle school may seem scary, but it's not! The bell rings at 9:05, where you will watch the morning announcements before begining your day. There is seven periods in a day, and you transition to each of them after the bell rings. Between bell rings, you have four minutes to go to your locker, use the restroom, and get between classes. More more information, read Middle School Tips or view the school navigation.

<h5>What is WEB?</h5>
<ul>
<li>WEB stands for “Where Everybody Belongs.”  At Edythe J. Hayes Middle School WEB means that we welcome and embrace students from diverse backgrounds and who have unique talents, interests and characteristics.</li>
<li>WEB is a yearlong program wherein 8<sup>th</sup> Grade Leaders conduct experiential activities to prepare incoming 6<sup>th</sup> Graders for middle school.  Activities include: A high-energy, inspirational Day 1 Assembly, monthly group activities, peer mentoring/tutoring, and structured gatherings.</li>
</ul>
<h5>The Main Components of WEB</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>6<sup>th</sup> Grade Transition</strong>:  WEB helps incoming 6<sup>th</sup> Grade Students make a successful transition to middle school through a variety of high-energy, engaging activities and practical tips for success.</li>
<li><strong>8<sup>th</sup> Grade Leadership Development</strong>:  WEB promotes Leadership and Service in 8<sup>th</sup> Grade students by providing training in leadership development, and organizing planned, intentional opportunities to serve incoming 6<sup>th</sup> Grade students.</li>
<li><strong>Creating a Welcoming School Environment</strong>:  WEB helps to establish a positive climate of cooperation and mutual respect in our school by teaching 8<sup>th</sup> Graders to treat 6<sup>th</sup> Graders with respect, and by celebrating the unique talents, interests and characteristics of others. </li>
</ul>
<h5>How it Works</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>WEB Leadership Academy</strong>:  Selected eighth grade students will have <span>two days of training during the summer</span> to become WEB Leaders (“mentors” to incoming 6<sup>th</sup> Graders), and will have training/support <span>throughout the year</span> to perform WEB Leader responsibilities.</li>
<li><strong>WEB Assembly</strong>:  On the first<span> day of school</span> all incoming sixth graders will participate in the WEB Assembly (Orientation), and then small group “friend-building” activities.</li>
<li><strong>Classroom Follow-Up</strong>:  WEB Leaders lead <span>monthly Character Ed. lessons</span> for all sixth Grade Classrooms (such as Integrity, Dealing with Rumors/Gossip, Responsibility, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>Social Follow-Up</strong>:  Periodic activities to foster school-connectedness, friendships, etc.</li>
<li><strong>WEB 1 to 1</strong>:  Pairings of WEB Leaders with specific sixth graders who may be struggling with grades, organization, peer relationships, etc.; <span>may happen daily, bi-weekly,</span> etc.</li>
<li><span><strong>Peer Tutoring</strong></span>: WEB Leaders will assist teachers in our new “Academics in Motion” (AIM) tutoring program, a <span>before-school program</span> to provide academic assistance to students in need.</li>
</ul>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Edythe J. Hayes Middle School, located southeast of town, was established in August 2004. Ours is one of the most technologically advanced middle schools in Kentucky. We have roughly one computer for every two students, including two
                      full computer labs. Every classroom has at least five computer workstations and an LCD projector. Integration of technology is a daily practice and a natural part of instruction, and we continue to push the envelope.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>What makes our school special</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Our mission statement charges the faculty and staff with engaging "all students in a safe and nurturing environment that promotes academic excellence and develops responsible, respectful leaders." This statement goes beyond school
                      climate - beyond high academic standards - and combines the two to create a developmentally responsive, socially equitable and academically challenging environment for our students. Our faculty and staff members work together to
                      give every child who passes through our doors the keys to success - not only in school, but also in the community. We believe in building relationships with our students that extend beyond the classroom and promote positive interactions
                      by using our guidelines to success - the Panther Promise: Learn Daily, Laugh Often, Lead Respectfully and Live Responsibly.</p>

	  <h2>Accelerated Learning Program</h2>
	  <p>In 2010, Edythe J. Hayes Middle School will launch the Accelerated Learning Program.  The Accelerated Learning Program allows for students to be flexibly scheduled into classes depending on need and ability level.</p>
	  <p>Students are scheduled into one of three areas- enhanced, core, or accelerated- based on their Measure of Academic Progress score, course common assessment scores, and teacher recommendation.  Unlike many programs that track students throughout their courses, students may be accelerated in one subject, but below grade level in another.  They are scheduled accordingly.</p>
	  <p>Also, students may be moved throughout the year depending on their response to the program.  In addition, we offer a range of intervention classes and programs for students in reading, writing, math, and behavior, both remedial and enrichment in nature.</p>
	  <h2>School-wide Instructional Strategies</h2>
	  <p>We employ several school wide and departmental instructional strategies, in an effort to prepare our studies for rigorous high school instruction.  The basis of these strategies is embedded in a Pre-Advanced Placement curriculum.  The primary goal of these strategies is to increase the number of students that enroll in Advanced Placement courses in high school.</p>

	  <h5>School-Wide Strategies</h5>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Frayer model vocabulary strategy</li>
      </ul>
	  <p>This is a vocabulary development tool. In contrast with a straight definition, the model helps to develop a better understanding of complex concepts by having students identify not just what something is, but what something is not.</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Panther Binder system</li>
      </ul>
	  <p>Each student is to have a three-inch, three-ring binder in order to teach organizational skills.  The school sells students tabbed dividers with GROW chart for each subject area.  Teachers are expected to develop a table of contents for their portion of the binder, and the table of contents is to be posted in every teacher&rsquo;s room for students to view.  The binder is checked for a class grade once every mid-term.</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Cornell Notes</li>
      </ul>
	  <p>The Cornell method provides a systematic format for condensing and organizing notes.</p>
	  <h5>Language arts</h5>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Laying the Foundation (LTF)</li>
      </ul>
	  <p>LTF training provides teachers with vertically-aligned model lessons that connect middle school and high school classes to analytical skills, content, and assessment strategies that will prepare students for AP classes and post-secondary coursework.</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Shared inquiry</li>
      </ul>
	  <p>This is a discussion method, a teaching and learning environment, and a way for individuals to achieve a more thorough understanding of a text by discussing questions, responses, and insights with fellow readers.</p>
	  <h5>Science</h5>
	  <ul>
	    <li>The Five Es (Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, Evaluate)</li>
      </ul>
	  <p>This is an instructional model based on the constructivist approach to learning, which says that learners build or construct new ideas on top of their old ideas. The 5 E's can be used with students of all ages, including adults.  Each of the 5 E's describes a phase of learning, and allows students and teachers to experience common activities, to use and build on prior knowledge and experience, to construct meaning, and to continually assess their understanding of a concept.</p>

	  <ul>
	    <li>Literacy Design Collaborative</li>
      </ul>
	  <p>Offers a framework for building the college-and-career-ready literacy skills specified by the Common Core State Standards.  Within LDC, students develop their reading and writing skill as they take on teaching tasks that set demanding assignments.  Teachers build out the approach by filling in LDC template tasks with content appropriate to their own classrooms and then designing LDC that show the skills and instruction students need to succeed.</p>
	  <ul>
      </ul>
	  <h5>Social Studies</h5>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Document Based Questions (DBQs)</li>
      </ul>
	  <p>This is an essay or series of short-answer questions that is constructed by students using one's own knowledge combined with support from several provided sources.</p>

	  <h2>Academic Course Offerings</h2>
	  <p>The academic block consists of year-long courses in which a group of teachers, usually two to five, from different subject areas share the responsibility for planning and delivering the instruction to meet the needs of the students.  We provide differentiated standards-based instruction guided by the Common Core Standards.  We meet all student instructional needs with our thoughfully designed remedial program and our new Accelerated Learning Program.</p>
	  <ul><li>
	    <h1>Language Arts</h1>
	    <div>
	      <p>This course builds on the reading, writing, speaking, viewing, and listening skills developed throughout elementary school.  Ability to communicate effectively is emphasized throughout this course.  Special attention is also given to comprehension skills and vocabulary development.</p>
	      <p>Our language arts classes employ <a href="http://www.advancekentucky.com/trainings/ltf">Laying the Foundation (LTF).</a> This is a training provides teachers with vertically-aligned model lessons that connect middle school and high school classes to analytical skills, content, and assessment strategies that will prepare students for AP classes and post-secondary coursework.</p>

	      <h1>Mathematics</h1>
	      <div>
	        <p>In each math course students will study number concepts, computation, estimation, functions, algebra, statistics, geometry, measurement, and probablity.  Students will be assigned to classes according to placement test results and teacher recommendations.</p>
	        <p>In sixth grade, students may qualify for sixth grade math or pre-algebra.  However, due to the rigorous demands of the new Common Core Standards, all students must take sixth grade math.  Those that qualify may choose to take pre-algebra as an exploratory class, thus taking a track that will lead them to geometry in the eighth grade.</p>
	        <p>In seventh grade, students may qualify for pre-algebra or algebra.</p>
	        <p>In eighth grade, students may qualify for eighth grade math, algebra, or geometry.</p>
